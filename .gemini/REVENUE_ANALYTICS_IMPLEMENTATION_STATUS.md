## Next: Frontend Implementation

The frontend needs updating to:
1. Add period filter UI
2. Add period change handler
3. Update fetchAnalytics to use period
4. Improve charts and visuals

**Due to the large size of the frontend component (1140 lines), would you like me to:**

**Option A**: Update the existing RevenueAnalytics.jsx in place (modify ~200 lines)

**Option B**: Create a new professional version that's cleaner and better organized

**I recommend Option A** (update in place) as it preserves your existing structure and null safety fixes.

**Shall I proceed with Option A?**
